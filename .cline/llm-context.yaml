  description: |
    Cline Extended - a fork of Cline with Architect Mode, ApprovalOracle,
    and LLM context checkpointing. Designed for rapid startup development.

completed_tasks:
  - Created full Cline Extended implementation from specs
  - Built mcp-approval-oracle standalone server (later removed)
  - Implemented Architect Mode (Opus plans, Sonnet implements)
  - Implemented ApprovalOracle with pattern matching
  - Implemented PersonaLoader for .cline/persona.md injection
  - Implemented ArchitectureAnalyzer for domain boundary checks
  - Implemented LLMContextManager for session persistence
  - Created ArchitectModeSection.tsx settings UI
  - Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
  - Built and packaged cline-extended-1.0.0.vsix (9.43 MB)
  - Simplified repo structure (removed mcp-approval-oracle, flattened cline-extended to root)
  - Updated README with fork rationale and startup focus
  - Pushed to GitHub (2 commits on main branch)
  - Installed extension in Cursor

pending_tasks:
  - Create GitHub release with VSIX (blocked: gh CLI needs auth in this shell)
  - Test extension in Cursor after reload

hot_files:
  - readme.md  # Updated with fork rationale
  - src/core/architect/ArchitectOrchestrator.ts  # Main orchestration logic
  - src/core/approval/ApprovalOracle.ts  # Action approval
  - webview-ui/src/components/settings/sections/ArchitectModeSection.tsx  # Settings UI
  - cline-extended-1.0.0.vsix  # Built extension package

key_decisions:
  - Removed standalone mcp-approval-oracle (ApprovalOracle is built into extension)
  - Flattened repo structure (cline-extended contents moved to root)
  - Used local React state for Architect settings (not wired to proto yet)
  - Target audience: Startups for rapid development, not enterprise

blockers:
  - GitHub CLI auth not persisting to Claude's shell session
  - Need to create GitHub release manually or re-auth gh CLI

next_steps:
  1. User reloads Cursor to test Cline Extended
  2. Create GitHub release with VSIX when auth issue resolved
  3. Test Architect Mode functionality
